# Sequence Alignment Algorithms ðŸ”¡

## Overview

This repository contains C++ implementations of two popular sequence alignment algorithms: Needleman-Wunsch and Hirschberg. These algorithms are widely used in bioinformatics and computational biology for aligning sequences such as DNA, RNA, or proteins ðŸ§¬.

## Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm

The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a dynamic programming approach for global sequence alignment. It computes the optimal alignment score and traceback to determine the aligned sequences. This implementation provides a clear and concise example of how to use the algorithm in C++.

### Usage

Just compile `NeedlemanWunsch.cpp` and run the code , providing input sequences as required in the head. The output will include the optimal alignment score and the aligned sequences.


## Hirschberg Algorithm

The Hirschberg algorithm is an improvement over Needleman-Wunsch in terms of space complexity. It uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to achieve linear space complexity, making it more memory-efficient. This implementation demonstrates the application of the Hirschberg algorithm in C++.

### Usage

Compile `Hirschberg.cpp` and run the code, providing input sequences as required. The output will include the aligned sequences.

## Compilation

Both implementations can be compiled using a standard C++ compiler, such as g++.
